function R1 = model1(t,initCond,p)

R1 = [initCond(1)];
R2 = 1;
u = 1;
T = cast(t, int) - 1

% this is a very stupid way to solve the R1_0 problem. It would be much
% easier to use an additional value returned by the function R1. However
% I'm afraid it wouldn't work for the ODE function

R1 = p.ks1 * (u/(1 + (R2/p.K2))) - p.k1 * R1(T)
